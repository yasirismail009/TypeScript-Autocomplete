        <li>User Personal Data</li>
        <p>
          Pligence Security and Privacy Defender App <b>DOES NOT</b> keep or

        </p>
        <p>
          We may request access to GPS sensor of your mobile device to monitor
          the application accessing the sensor, however PLIGENCE DOES NOT

        </p>
        <li>Unique identifier of the mobile device</li>
        <p>
          Pligence Security and Privacy Defender App uses unique user id known
          as ANDROID_ID generated every time Android device goes through a
          factory reset. We do not process the User ID in clear text; we only
          process and store its hash sum. In case user has reset the value of
          the ANDROID_ID, the new value of the unique identifier of the mobile
          device will not be associated with the old value.

        2. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FOR THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE APP?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
        operation of our App, for troubleshooting and for our internal analytics
        and reporting purposes. Regardless of the type of data and territory
        where data was received or processed, we use the highest standards of
        data protection and apply various legal, organizational, and technical
        measures in order to protect user data, guarantee safety and
        confidentiality, as well as ensure users' rights guaranteed under
        applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>If you use our App, we also collect the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>license/Subscription Information</li>
        <p>
          It is processed in order to recognize legitimate users. This data is
          needed to maintain communication between the product and Pligence
          back-end services â€“ sending and receiving product databases, updates,
          etc.
        </p>
        <li>Product Information</li>
        <p>
          Data on the product's operation and its interaction with the user is
          also analyzed. For example, how long does it take to block a malicious
          remote /web site.? Which features are used more often than others?
          Answers to these and other questions help developers to improve
          products, making them faster and easier to use.
        </p>
        <li>URLs Visited</li>
        <p>
          URLs can be sent to be checked whether they are malicious through the
          mobile Accessibility feature. This information also helps to create
          lists of "white" or harmless websites and prevents security products
          from mistakenly identifying such websites as malicious. This data is
          also used to update and extend website categories. Information about
          logins and passwords, if contained in the initial browser request from
          the user, is removed from the visited URL addresses up to the hostname
          or IP address. Pligence does not process Username or Passwords.
        </p>
        <li>Threat detection</li>
        <p>
          If a threat (new or known) is found on a device, information about
          that threat is sent to Pligence. This enables us to analyze threats,
          their sources, principles of infection, etc., resulting in a higher
          quality of protection for every user.
        </p>
        <li>Application Reputation</li>
        <p>
          If an Application exhibiting suspicious behavior is detected on a
          device, it can be automatically sent for a more thorough analysis
          using static and dynamic mechanisms. The 'suspicious' category
          includes mainly APK (.apk). For the purpose of reducing the likelihood
          of false positives, executable and non-executable "white files" or
          their parts may be sent.
        </p>
        <li>Surveillance Protection</li>
        <p>
          New malware can often be identified only by its suspicious behavior,
          for example using the device sensors such as microphone, camera, GPS
          and processes. Because of this, the product analyzes data based on
          sensor access, permissions and processes running on the device. This
          makes it possible to identify early on processes that indicate
          malicious activity and to prevent any damaging consequences, such as
          the destruction of user data.
        </p>
        <li>Device data and settings</li>
        <p>
          Data such as device type, operating system, installed applications,
          permissions granted, configured settings etc. may be needed to help us
          to analyze cyberthreats, because it shows how many devices are
          affected by any specific threat. This information helps to create
          lists of "white" or harmless applications and prevents security
          products from mistakenly identifying such applications as malicious.
          This data is also used to update and extend program categories for
          features like Application Reputation Analysis.
        </p>
        <li>Wi-Fi connection data</li>
        <p>
          This information is analyzed in order to warn users of insecure (i.e.,
          poorly protected) Wi-Fi access points, helping to prevent personal
          data from being inadvertently intercepted.

        13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
      </h3>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
