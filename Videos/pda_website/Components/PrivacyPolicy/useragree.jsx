        Terms specific to certain products and services 
      </h3>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">Additional terms</h3>
      <p>
        Some of our software have a few extra terms of service not covered here.
        You can find more information on our website.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">Mobile Firewall </h3>
      <p>
        We will make every reasonable effort to stop Application from carrying
        out malicious activities through a variety of different ways such as the
        implementation of use cases and behavior analysis, however, we cannot
        guarantee that all Applications performing malicious activities will be
        blocked because some malicious activities performed by Applications may
        be way more sophisticated and may only be carried out occasionally.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">Web Guard</h3>
      <p>
        Web Guard is used to provide safe browsing experience to Mobile User.
        Web Guard is only supported currently when using Google Chrome browser.
        Web Guard has built-in intelligence to stop Mobile User from visiting
        malicious sites, however it cannot identify every threat or understand
        the nature of every website. Ratings does not guarantee a site is
        completely free from risk, and good ratings don’t mean we endorse the
        website, or it’s services.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">Secure Vault</h3>
      <p>
        When using Secure Vault, Mobile User need to understand that we never
        have a copy of your master password or your encryption keys, so you are
        responsible for keeping them safe. Use a strong, hard to guess master
        password and keep your keys in a safe place, because if you lose them,
        we cannot help you get back into your account and all your data stored
        in Secure Vault will be lost. There is no “reset password” option.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">Privacy Lock/App Lock</h3>
      <p>
        Privacy Lock by Pligence (Makers of Privacy Defender) protects your
        privacy by locking your Mobile Apps from kids, family, friends, and
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy Lock can be used to lock Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat,
        Messenger, and any other Apps you choose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Device Admin Permission is required to stop people from uninstalling the
        Privacy Lock App when sharing the phone with others. Once enabled App
        can only be uninstalled if Mobile Phone PIN is known.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">App Reputation</h3>
      <p>
        App Reputation module identifies the Application with known
        vulnerabilities, Applications installed from unknown sources gives
        Rating based on App Reputation based on user comments and App behavior
        analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        As much as we pride ourselves in keeping a detailed database of Mobile
        Apps and identifying malicious behavior, App Reputation does not
        guarantee that the Apps identified as bad have been compromised or are a
        definite threat, similarly a good App rating does not mean we endorse
        the installed Application.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">Security Scan</h3>
      <p>
        Security Scan checks your Mobile settings and identifies any
        misconfiguration or settings that could allow the criminals to misuse
        the phone or install Apps without user’s knowledge. It also scans your
        connected Wi-Fi Network to identify if the Wi-Fi network that you are
        connected to has implemented secure protocols, this is no way implies
        that your Mobile Phone is completely secure and cannot be compromised
        using other methods.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">Disclaimers</h3>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">Attacks on Data</h3>
      <p>
        Security breaches might involve attacks on your data. For example,
        viruses and other malware might delete, destroy, alter or encrypt data
        and files on your device. If this happens, you could lose access to your
        data and files. You agree that it is your responsibility to back-up and
        store all data and files on your devices so you can safely restore them,
        if you need to. As we mentioned earlier in these Terms, hard drive and
        cloud storage space is cheap. You should back up your important files to
        a reputable online data storage service and do it often. We’re not
        liable for any lost or damaged files or interruptions as a result of
        attacks on your data.

        physical or property damage. We do not make any express or implied
        warranty of fitness for high-risk activities.

      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that the limitations of liability and disclaimers in this
        section reflect the fee charged for the software, which would be higher
        without these limitations. Nothing in this agreement limits any rights
        you may have under existing consumer-protection statutes or other
        applicable laws that may not be waived in your jurisdiction, including
        those specifically mentioned in the local law section.
