        This Cookie Policy explains how Pligence (PVT) Ltd. ("Company", "we",
        "us", and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you
        when you visit our websites at{" "}

        , ("Websites"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use
        them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or
        that becomes personal information if we combine it with other
        information.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
        device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website
        owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
        efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Pligence (PVT) Ltd.) are
        called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the
        website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies
        enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or
        through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and
        analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize
        your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when
        it visits certain other websites.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
        are required for technical reasons for our Websites to operate, and we
        refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other
        cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
        enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve
        cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics, and other
        purposes. This is described in more detail below.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our
        Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note
        that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific
        Online Properties you visit):
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">How can I control cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
        can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
        Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select
        which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies
        cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
        on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
        website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
        website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
        controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can
        refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
        browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more
        information.

        What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
        website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like
        web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These
        are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us
        to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail
        including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic
        patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver
        or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the
        website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website,
        to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail
        marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant
        on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair
        their functioning.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">
        Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
        Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store
        information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for
        other site operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust
        the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using
        the tools contained in the{" "}

        explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to
        "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
        being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash

        Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
        acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of
        some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used
